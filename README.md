Predictive Analysis of Bakery Sales

Focus
-The primary objectives of this project include:

-Preprocessing time-series data to extract meaningful features like hour and day type.
-Performing classification to predict weekend vs. weekday sales using logistic regression.
-Conducting linear regression to predict bread sales quantity based on the time of day.
-Visualizing results with scatter plots, regression lines, and heatmaps to better understand the data and model performance.
-Demonstrating model evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, sensitivity, and specificity to assess classification accuracy.

Technologies Used
Programming Language
- Python
  
Libraries and Tools
-Data Analysis and Visualization:

--pandas for data manipulation.
--matplotlib, seaborn for visualizations.

-Machine Learning:

--scikit-learn for classification (Logistic Regression) and regression (Linear Regression).
--numpy for numerical computations.

Evaluation Metrics:

-sklearn.metrics for generating confusion matrices, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy scores.

Impact
This project offers valuable insights into how machine learning can be applied to time-series sales data in the food and beverage industry. Retailers and bakeries can:

-Optimise staffing based on peak sales times.
-Better allocate resources to high-demand periods.
-Predict sales trends to minimise waste and maximise profits.

Course Connection:
This project showcases skills acquired during the course Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification by Coursera.

Key concepts applied:
-Preprocessing and feature engineering for machine learning models.
-Implementing logistic regression and linear regression to solve real-world problems.
-Model evaluation using metrics like confusion matrices and RÂ² scores.
